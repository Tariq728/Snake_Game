## How to Play Snake Game

### Option 1: Play by Running the Python Script

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tariq728/Snake_Game.git
   cd Snake_Game

2. **Install requirements:**
   You may need Python installed. If there is a `requirements.txt` (often for `pygame`), run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   _If no `requirements.txt`, you might just need:_
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the game:**

   python main.py
   ```
   _Replace `main.py` with your start file’s name if different._
